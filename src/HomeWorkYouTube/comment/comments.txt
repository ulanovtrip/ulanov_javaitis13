I've tried Gnome 40 myself and immediately fell in  love with  it
Wow looks good.. I still remember the backlash that Gnome 3 got when it moved away from gtx2/gnome2 .. but this time around I think people are more accepting of Gnome 40.. yes its a big update but not as knee jerking as it was going from Gnome 2 to Gnome 3..
I'm a KDE user and don't like GNOME, but damn, GNOME 40 looks really good.
This will be monumental for the pinephone I think. Screw phosh, just make this scale down to a mobile form factor and map the gesture actions to touch and you have a fully realised mobile shell.
Gnome 40 just feels complete. Very much impressed. Tho I use KDE, but also GNOME from time to time :D
I already tested it a few weeks ago in GnomeOS, I like it but I thought from the start that it is kind of the same and not a complete change
Wow, those 36 other versions passed so quickly!
It feels like they designed the new GNOME with touchscreen in mind. I wish I had a tablet to test it on, it looks really appealing.
I love how new gnome looks. I'm curious how canonical would implement it in the future ubuntu release.
The push for 1:1 gestures for trackpads has me so excited!
The hand gestures alone make me want to reinstall this on my laptop. I've been using Sway recently, and absolutely love that, but a DE just does certain things better
Looks like a hybrid between Gnome 3 and Elementary OS , also this version looks like it's made for touch screens .
Damn, missed versions 4-39.
i am so excited for this to start coming to distributions. like to the point where i might install debian sid or fedora just to get it faster haha
OMG, FINALLY, so much easier. I was waiting for this for a while now. Still not fully satisfied but hey we are going somewhere. This will make our custom setup much easier in the future. Also Gnome needs to work a bit on the battery usage for laptops.
The trackpad gesture alone makes this version of GNOME looks neat.
Sooo now it just looks like macOS? Absolutely love it though, I'm definitely gonna have to try it out
Can't wait for this to come out on Ubuntu!
At first I was very skeptical about the update, but now.... I'm soo excited!!
The three-finger gestures are so good! I installed Fedora 34 yesterday and I'm already in love, the GNOME devs did an incredible job with this update.
Thanks for the news, you've became my source of open source / Linux news, appreciate your content.
Gnome 40 feels very professional, great down to the details!
GOOD LORD, three finger swype to change workspaces is what I've been waiting for ever since I started using Fedora! LOVE IT
